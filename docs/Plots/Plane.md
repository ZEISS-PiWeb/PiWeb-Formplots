### Plane plot

![plane plot][preview]

#### Description

The plane plot shows deviations on a plane in the planes normal direction. The plane is usually displayed in an isometric perspective.

#### Point structure

* Position Axis 1 (1D)
* Position Axis 2 (1D)
* Deviation

Unlike in other plots, the position coordinates are specified separately. Make sure the points don't form a straight line, as the plot will not display them in this case. If you want to display a line on purpose, use the [line plot](Line.md).

#### Geometry

The _actual_ geometries parameters `Length1` and `Length2` are multiplied with the points respective coordinate ranges to define dimensions of the plot. By specifying a different value for `Length1` and `Length2`, the displayed plot can be stretched.

#### Example

```csharp
var plot = new FlatnessPlot();

var segment = new Segment<PlanePoint, PlaneGeometry>( "All", SegmentTypes.Line );
plot.Segments.Add( segment );

var rand = new Random( DateTime.Now.Millisecond );

//The plot point coordinates will be multiplied with the length values when the plot is displayed.
plot.Actual.Length1 = 5.0;
plot.Actual.Length2 = 1.0;

for( var i = 0; i < count; i++ )
{
	var share = ( double ) i / count;
	var x = Math.Sin( share * 2.0 * Math.PI );
	var y = share * 2.0 * Math.PI;

	var deviation = ( rand.NextDouble() - 0.5 ) * 0.2;

	var point = new PlanePoint( x, y, deviation );
	
	segment.Points.Add( point );
}

plot.Tolerance = new Tolerance( -0.1, 0.1 );
plot.DefaultErrorScaling = 100;
```

#### Remarks

* Currently, the plot can't display tolerances.
* The plot points must not lay in one line.
